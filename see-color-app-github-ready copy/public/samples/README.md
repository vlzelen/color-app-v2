# Sample Images

This directory should contain sample images for testing the color cast analysis:

- `portrait.jpg` - A portrait photo with potential color cast issues
- `gray-card.jpg` - A neutral gray card for testing neutral detection

## Adding Sample Images

To add your own sample images:

1. Place a portrait photo as `portrait.jpg`
2. Place a gray card or neutral reference as `gray-card.jpg`
3. Ensure images are in JPG format for best compatibility

The app will use these images when users click the "Sample Portrait" or "Gray Card" buttons.
